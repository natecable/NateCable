## My Blockchain
- This project was done in reference to my previous work in Java, which can be found [here](../MyBlockchain)
- The goal of this project was to create a blockchain of the same vein, but in Rust
- It began with the development of a Merkle Tree and ended with a functional blockchain
- To run the program with the given test files, compile both folders and run the following command within the rustchain folder:
```cargo run /datafiles output.txt```
