# Blockchain Benchmarking Standardized Framework
- This research project is not yet open-sourced, so I have only provided the code I did for the DEX workload (see [DEX](DEX/)) and NFT Marketplace workload (see [NFTMarketplace](NFTMarketplace/))
- I have attached our published [research paper](Blockbench_v3.pdf) as well as a [poster](BBSF_Poster.pptx.pdf) that neatly summarizes our framework implementation
